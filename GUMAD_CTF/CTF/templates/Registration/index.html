<h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Gonzaga University School of Engineering and Applied Science.</li>
    <!-- <li>Food will hopefully be provided?</li> -->
    <li>Teams of 1-4. If there are two freshman on the team, then a team is allowed
        5 or 6. Freshman are highly encouraged because we want them to come and learn!</li>
    <li>Slack channel for teams to communicate.</li>
    <li>Time estimate: 6 hours. We promise this will be a lot of fun, so worth the
        time!</li>
    <li>There are two types of challenges. Read on!</li>
</ul>

<h3> Attack/defense </h3>
Defend your service while trying to exploit others! Once you find an exploit you patch your own system then attack the others!

<li>Solving a wargame will give x number of points, depending on the difficulty and effort needed to solve the challenge. More points given to the first team that solves a challenge (1.5x). </li>

<li>To return a flag, go to to gameboard where the challenge was given (unless otherwise stated). </li>

<li>Wargame challenges can recieve extra points if a mitigation report is sent to the judges of the challenge.  </li>

<li>
These challenges will have a flag somewhere within the challenge. The hacker must find the flag, then return it for the points.</li>

<li>For the competitions without a flag, there will be spefific rules that will be specified in the challenge. </li>

<h3> Wargame </h3>
There's a challenge on a board, you are told how to access the challenge. Solve it, find the flag, then return the flag. These challenges could range from crypto, to social engineering to ... Use your imagination! The categories are: Software, Crypto, Social Engineering and Miscellaneous. 
<ul>
<li>In order to recieve points, attack the other teams box. The flags value will rotate once per hour; this means that a team can get points once per hour per exploit. </li> 

<li> Once you have taken the flag, then return the flag to the scoreboard. </li>

<li>
Keep your service up as much as possible. Points will be subtracted if the service is not up. 
</li>

<li>
Defensively, if a malicious payload is seen, then report this to the officials for extra points (limit 3 per team). 
</li>

<li>
Please harden the systems; not the flags. If we find you hardening the flags or changing the flags then you will lose a major amount of points. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Play Nice </h3>
This is supossed to be a great learning experience and a fun time; please do not try to cheat the system...
<ul>
    <li>No external, automated tools besides nmap (I'm talking about using Kali and
    other things). Using google for answers is completely fine though.</li>
    <li>No DOS attacks on machines.</li>
    <li>Do not attack the scoreboard site.</li>
</ul>


Should be a fun and learning atomsphere.
People should be helpful.
